# Ascii-Art-Converter
This project allows users to convert images into ASCII art directly in the browser. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the tool allows users to upload an image, which is then processed and transformed into a text-based representation using ASCII characters. It showcases the power of client-side JavaScript for image manipulation and conversion.
